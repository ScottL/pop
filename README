the source files are commented.  look through those for a general idea of how
things work and what we have to do.

Our priorities include:
-clean up all the code/reorganize the design
-optimize
-fix bugs
-improve
-optimize
-re-theme

WHEN TRYING TO COMPLETELY REWRITE A METHOD, KEEP THE OLD METHOD THERE BUT WITH 
A DIFFERENT NAME.. until you are sure the new method works

ALSO document all changes you make with comments. the comments should stay until
the change is determined to actually be good
